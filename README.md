# Web Games 

These are some web games that I made for my family to play together and to keep coding while I was on parental leave.

## Tic Tac Toe

This is the most simple of the games and was the first thing that I made and played.

## Snake

First time using the ```<canvas>``` element in html and that is really cool. This one supports controllers too!
